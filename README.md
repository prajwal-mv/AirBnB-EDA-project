Performing Exploratory Data Analysis on dataset “ Airbnb ”

Airbnb has become a very popular choice among travelers around the world for the kind of unique experiences that they provide and also for presenting an alternative to costly hotels. It is currently present in more than 34000+cities across 190 countries. Customers can make their bookings either through the website application or using the iOS/Android application. Airbnb is consistently trying to improve this booking experience to make it easier for the first time customer.

The problem that this case study is dealing with predicts the location that a user is most likely to book for the first time. The accurate prediction helps to decrease the average time required to book by sharing more personalized recommendations and also in better forecasting of the demand. We use the browser’s session data as well as the user’s demographic information that is provided to us to create features that help in solving the problem.
